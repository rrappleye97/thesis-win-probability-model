# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Predicting the winner of a given National Football League (NFL) game has long been of interest to fans, pundits and gamblers alike. Many factors can influence the outcome of game. Some more obvious factors might include the current score differential, the amount of time left, the down and distance to go to pick up a first down, the current yard line, and the strength of each team’s offensive, defensive and special teams units. Some less obvious factors might include the number of timeouts each team has left, the stadium in which the teams are playing, the weather, which team will receive the second half kickoff, and the in-game decision making capabilities of the respective coaches. 

Others have developed in-game win probability models using some of these factors. Lock & Nettleton (2014) used a random forest model that takes in a number of variables aimed at describing the current game state, a variable—total points scored—that might offer insight into the level of variance associated with the game environment, and the pre-game point spread as a measure of relative team strengths and outputs the probability the team with possession of the football will win the game. Pro-Football-Reference (PFR) has published an in-game win probability model that expands on previous research by Hal Stern and Wayne Winston and treats the change in score from a given point until the end of the game as a normal distribution and calculates win probability by finding the proportion of the normal probability density function that corresponds to a final score differential that is greater than zero. A different unspecified model is used for game states where less than five minutes remain. The mean of the PFR normal distribution is taken to be the current score differential plus the expected points added (EPA), a feature designed by PFR to find the value of a given combination of down, distance to first down, yard line and time remaining in the half, and the variance is taken to be 13.45 multiplied by the fraction of game time that remains (link). Maksim Horowitz and Ron Yurko developed a win probability model (and the wonderful nflscrapR package that was used to load in the play by play data used in this analysis) that they describe as “ a generalized additive model using the expected score differential, time remaining in game [that] also [accounts] for the timeouts remaining for both teams” with a separate calculation for overtime probabilities. ESPN also boasts a win probability model. I was not able to find a description of ESPN’s methods on its site, but in 2017 Michael Lopez, then an assistant professor at Skidmore College, now the NFL’s Director of Data and Analytics, described the model as “derived from an ensemble of machine learning models” (link). 

Unfortunately, of these models, only the results from the model developed by Horowitz and Yurko are available online, though Lock and Nettleton give a summary of their model’s effectiveness when tested on the 2013 NFL season (and they shared the results of an updated model for games during the 2017 season to allow for a comparison with the results of this analysis). This makes an evaluation of the effectiveness of different methods difficult. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of an in-game NFL win probability model that predicts win probability only before kickoffs and utilizes a series of models to advance other game states to kickoff.


**Why use it?**

_R Markdown_ creates a simple and straightforward way to interface with the beauty of LaTeX.  Packages have been written in **R** to work directly with LaTeX to produce nicely formatting tables and paragraphs. In addition to creating a user friendly interface to LaTeX, _R Markdown_ also allows you to read in your data, to analyze it and to visualize it using **R** functions, and also to provide the documentation and commentary on the results of your project.  Further, it allows for **R** results to be passed inline to the commentary of your results.  You'll see more on this later.  

Having your code and commentary all together in one place has a plethora of benefits!

**Who should use it?**

Anyone who needs to use data analysis, math, tables, a lot of figures, complex cross-references, or who just cares about the final appearance of their document should use _R Markdown_. Of particular use should be anyone in the sciences, but the user-friendly nature of _Markdown_ and its ability to keep track of and easily include figures, automatically generate a table of contents, index, references, table of figures, etc. should make it of great benefit to nearly anyone writing a thesis project.

<!--chapter:end:index.Rmd-->

<!--
This is for including Chapter 1.  Notice that it's also good practice to name your chunk.  This will help you debug potential issues as you knit.  The chunk above is called intro and the one below is called chapter1.  Feel free to change the name of the Rmd file as you wish, but don't forget to change it here from chap1.Rmd.

<!--
The {#rmd-basics} text after the chapter declaration will allow us to link throughout the document back to the beginning of Chapter 1.

-->

# R Markdown Basics {#rmd-basics}

Here is a brief introduction into using _R Markdown_. _Markdown_ is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. _R Markdown_ provides the flexibility of _Markdown_ with the implementation of **R** input and output.  For more details on using _R Markdown_ see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.  

Be careful with your spacing in _Markdown_ documents.  While whitespace largely is ignored, it does at times give _Markdown_ signals as to how to proceed.  As a habit, try to keep everything left aligned whenever possible, especially as you type a new paragraph.  In other words, there is no need to indent basic text in the Rmd document (in fact, it might cause your text to do funny things if you do).

## Lists

It's easy to create a list.  It can be unordered like

* Item 1
* Item 2

or it can be ordered like

1. Item 1
4. Item 2

Notice that I intentionally mislabeled Item 2 as number 4.  _Markdown_ automatically figures this out!  You can put any numbers in the list and it will create the list.  Check it out below.

To create a sublist, just indent the values a bit (at least four spaces or a tab).  (Here's one case where indentation is key!)

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
    - Item 3a
    - Item 3b

## Line breaks

Make sure to add white space between lines if you'd like to start a new paragraph.  Look at what happens below in the outputted document if you don't:

Here is the first sentence.  Here is another sentence.  Here is the last sentence to end the paragraph.
This should be a new paragraph.

*Now for the correct way:* 

Here is the first sentence.  Here is another sentence.  Here is the last sentence to end the paragraph.

This should be a new paragraph.

## R chunks

When you click the **Knit** button above a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded **R** code chunks within the document. You can embed an **R** code chunk like this (`cars` is a built-in **R** dataset):

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Inline code

If you'd like to put the results of your analysis directly into your discussion, add inline code like this:

> The `cos` of $2 \pi$ is `r cos(2*pi)`. 

Another example would be the direct calculation of the standard deviation:

> The standard deviation of `speed` in `cars` is `r sd(cars$speed)`.

One last neat feature is the use of the `ifelse` conditional statement which can be used to output text depending on the result of an **R** calculation:

> `r ifelse(sd(cars$speed) < 6, "The standard deviation is less than 6.", "The standard deviation is equal to or greater than 6.")`

Note the use of `>` here, which signifies a quotation environment that will be indented.

As you see with `$2 \pi$` above, mathematics can be added by surrounding the mathematical text with dollar signs.  More examples of this are in [Mathematics and Science] if you uncomment the code in [Math].  

## Including plots

You can also embed plots.  For example, here is a way to use the base **R** graphics package to produce a plot using the built-in `pressure` dataset:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo=FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the **R** code that generated the plot.  There are plenty of other ways to add chunk options.  More information is available at <http://yihui.name/knitr/options/>.  

Another useful chunk option is the setting of `cache=TRUE` as you see here.  If document rendering becomes time consuming due to long computations or plots that are expensive to generate you can use knitr caching to improve performance.  Later in this file, you'll see a way to reference plots created in **R** or external figures.

## Loading and exploring data

Included in this template is a file called `flights.csv`.  This file includes a subset of the larger dataset of information about all flights that departed from Seattle and Portland in 2014.  More information about this dataset and its **R** package is available at <http://github.com/ismayc/pnwflights14>.  This subset includes only Portland flights and only rows that were complete with no missing values.  Merges were also done with the `airports` and `airlines` data sets in the `pnwflights14` package to get more descriptive airport and airline names.

We can load in this data set using the following command:

```{r load_data}
flights <- read.csv("data/flights.csv")
```

The data is now stored in the data frame called `flights` in **R**.  To get a better feel for the variables included in this dataset we can use a variety of functions.  Here we can see the dimensions (rows by columns) and also the names of the columns.

```{r str}
dim(flights)
names(flights)
```

Another good idea is to take a look at the dataset in table form.  With this dataset having more than 50,000 rows, we won't explicitly show the results of the command here.  I recommend you enter the command into the Console **_after_** you have run the **R** chunks above to load the data into **R**.

```{r view_flights, eval=FALSE}
View(flights)
```

While not required, it is highly recommended you use the `dplyr` package to manipulate and summarize your data set as needed.  It uses a syntax that is easy to understand using chaining operations.  Below I've created a few examples of using `dplyr` to get information about the Portland flights in 2014.  You will also see the use of the `ggplot2` package, which produces beautiful, high-quality academic visuals.

We begin by checking to ensure that needed packages are installed and then we load them into our current working environment:

```{r load_pkgs, message=FALSE}
# List of packages required for this analysis
pkg <- c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "knitr", "bookdown", "devtools")
# Check if packages are not installed and assign the
# names of the packages not installed to the variable new.pkg
new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages())]
# If there are any packages in the list that aren't installed,
# install them
if (length(new.pkg))
  install.packages(new.pkg, repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
# Load packages (thesisdowndss will load all of the packages as well)
library(thesisdowndss)
```

\clearpage

The example we show here does the following:

- Selects only the `carrier_name` and `arr_delay` from the `flights` dataset and then assigns this subset to a new variable called `flights2`. 

- Using `flights2`, we determine the largest arrival delay for each of the carriers.

```{r max_delays}
flights2 <- flights %>% 
  select(carrier_name, arr_delay)
max_delays <- flights2 %>% 
  group_by(carrier_name) %>%
  summarize(max_arr_delay = max(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

A useful function in the `knitr` package for making nice tables in _R Markdown_ is called `kable`.  It is much easier to use than manually entering values into a table by copying and pasting values into Excel or LaTeX.  This again goes to show how nice reproducible documents can be! (Note the use of `results="asis"`, which will produce the table instead of the code to create the table.)  The `caption.short` argument is used to include a shorter title to appear in the List of Tables.

```{r maxdelays, results="asis"}
kable(max_delays, 
      col.names = c("Airline", "Max Arrival Delay"),
      caption = "Maximum Delays by Airline",
      caption.short = "Max Delays by Airline",
      longtable = TRUE,
      booktabs = TRUE)
```

The last two options make the table a little easier-to-read.

We can further look into the properties of the largest value here for American Airlines Inc.  To do so, we can isolate the row corresponding to the arrival delay of 1539 minutes for American in our original `flights` dataset.


```{r max_props}
flights %>% filter(arr_delay == 1539, 
                  carrier_name == "American Airlines Inc.") %>%
  select(-c(month, day, carrier, dest_name, hour, 
            minute, carrier_name, arr_delay))
```

We see that the flight occurred on March 3rd and departed a little after 2 PM on its way to Dallas/Fort Worth.  Lastly, we show how we can visualize the arrival delay of all departing flights from Portland on March 3rd against time of departure.

```{r march3plot, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
flights %>% filter(month == 3, day == 3) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dep_time, y = arr_delay)) + geom_point()
```

## Math

\TeX\ is the best way to typeset mathematics. Donald Knuth designed \TeX\ when he got frustrated at how long it was taking the typesetters to finish his book, which contained a lot of mathematics.  One nice feature of _R Markdown_ is its ability to read LaTeX code directly.

If you are doing a thesis that will involve lots of math, you will want to read the following section.

$$\sum_{j=1}^n (\delta\theta_j)^2 \leq {{\beta_i^2}\over{\delta_i^2 + \rho_i^2}}
\left[ 2\rho_i^2 + {\delta_i^2\beta_i^2\over{\delta_i^2 + \rho_i^2}} \right] \equiv \omega_i^2
$$

From Informational Dynamics, we have the following (Dave Braden):

After _n_ such encounters the posterior density for $\theta$ is

$$
\pi(\theta|X_1< y_1,\dots,X_n<y_n) \varpropto \pi(\theta) \prod_{i=1}^n\int_{-\infty}^{y_i}
   \exp\left(-{(x-\theta)^2\over{2\sigma^2}}\right)\ dx
$$

Another equation:

$$\det\left|\,\begin{matrix}%
c_0&c_1\hfill&c_2\hfill&\ldots&c_n\hfill\cr
c_1&c_2\hfill&c_3\hfill&\ldots&c_{n+1}\hfill\cr
c_2&c_3\hfill&c_4\hfill&\ldots&c_{n+2}\hfill\cr
\,\vdots\hfill&\,\vdots\hfill&
  \,\vdots\hfill&&\,\vdots\hfill\cr
c_n&c_{n+1}\hfill&c_{n+2}\hfill&\ldots&c_{2n}\hfill\cr
\end{matrix}\right|>0$$

# Tables, Graphics, References, and Labels {#ref-labels}

## Tables

In addition to the tables that can be automatically generated from a data frame in **R** that you saw in [R Markdown Basics] using the `kable` function, you can also create tables using _pandoc_. (More information is available at <http://pandoc.org/README.html#tables>.)  This might be useful if you don't have values specifically stored in **R**, but you'd like to display them in table form.  Below is an example.  Pay careful attention to the alignment in the table and hyphens to create the rows and columns.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Factors                    Correlation between Parents & Child      Inherited
------------------------- ----------------------------------------- --------------
  Education                                -0.49                         Yes
  
  Socio-Economic Status                     0.28                        Slight   
  
  Income                                    0.08                          No
  
  Family Size                               0.18                        Slight
  
  Occupational Prestige                     0.21                        Slight
------------------------- ----------------------------------------- --------------
Table: (\#tab:inher) Correlation of Inheritance Factors for Parents and Child 

We can also create a link to the table by doing the following: Table \@ref(tab:inher).  If you go back to [Loading and exploring data] and look at the `kable` table, we can create a reference to this max delays table too: Table \@ref(tab:maxdelays). The addition of the `(\#tab:inher)` option to the end of the table caption allows us to then make a reference to Table `\@ref(tab:label)`. Note that this reference could appear anywhere throughout the document after the table has appeared.  

<!-- We will next explore ways to create this label-ref link using figures. -->

\clearpage

<!-- clearpage ends the page, and also dumps out all floats.
  Floats are things like tables and figures. -->


## Figures

If your thesis has a lot of figures, _R Markdown_ might behave better for you than that other word processor.  One perk is that it will automatically number the figures accordingly in each chapter.    You'll also be able to create a label for each figure, add a caption, and then reference the figure in a way similar to what we saw with tables earlier.  If you label your figures, you can move the figures around and _R Markdown_ will automatically adjust the numbering for you.  No need for you to remember!  So that you don't have to get too far into LaTeX to do this, a couple **R** functions have been created for you to assist.  You'll see their use below.

<!--
One thing that may be annoying is the way _R Markdown_ handles "floats" like tables and figures (it's really \LaTeX's fault). \LaTeX\ will try to find the best place to put your object based on the text around it and until you're really, truly done writing you should just leave it where it lies. There are some optional arguments specified in the options parameter of the `label` function.  If you need to shift your figure around, it might be good to look here on tweaking the options argument:  <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions>

If you need a graphic or tabular material to be part of the text, you can just put it inline. If you need it to appear in the list of figures or tables, it should be placed in a code chunk.
-->


In the **R** chunk below, we will load in a picture stored as `duke.png` in our main directory.  We then give it the caption of "Duke logo", the label of "dukelogo", and specify that this is a figure.  Make note of the different **R** chunk options that are given in the R Markdown file (not shown in the knitted document).

```{r dukelogo, fig.cap="Duke logo"}
include_graphics(path = "figure/duke.png")
```

Here is a reference to the Duke logo: Figure \@ref(fig:dukelogo).  Note the use of the `fig:` code here.  By naming the **R** chunk that contains the figure, we can then reference that figure later as done in the first sentence here.  We can also specify the caption for the figure via the R chunk option `fig.cap`.

\clearpage 

<!-- starts a new page and stops trying to place floats such as tables and figures -->

Below we will investigate how to save the output of an **R** plot and label it in a way similar to that done above.  Recall the `flights` dataset from Chapter \@ref(rmd-basics).  (Note that we've shown a different way to reference a section or chapter here.)  We will next explore a bar graph with the mean flight departure delays by airline from Portland for 2014.  Note also the use of the `scale` parameter which is discussed on the next page.

```{r delaysboxplot, warnings=FALSE, messages=FALSE, fig.cap="Mean Delays by Airline", fig.width=6}
flights %>% group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carrier, y = mean_dep_delay)) +
  geom_bar(position = "identity", stat = "identity", fill = "red")
```

Here is a reference to this image: Figure \@ref(fig:delaysboxplot).

A table linking these carrier codes to airline names is available at <https://github.com/ismayc/pnwflights14/blob/master/data/airlines.csv>.

\clearpage

Next, we will explore the use of the `out.extra` chunk option, which can be used to shrink or expand an image loaded from a file by specifying `"scale= "`. Here we use the mathematical graph stored in the "subdivision.pdf" file.

```{r subd, results="asis", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Subdiv. graph", out.extra="scale=0.75"}
include_graphics("figure/subdivision.pdf")
```

Here is a reference to this image: Figure \@ref(fig:subd).  Note that `echo=FALSE` is specified so that the **R** code is hidden in the document.

**More Figure Stuff**

Lastly, we will explore how to rotate and enlarge figures using the `out.extra` chunk option.  (Currently this only works in the PDF version of the book.)

```{r subd2, results="asis", echo=FALSE, out.extra="angle=180, scale=1.1", fig.cap="A Larger Figure, Flipped Upside Down"}
include_graphics("figure/subdivision.pdf")
```

As another example, here is a reference: Figure \@ref(fig:subd2).  

## Footnotes and Endnotes

You might want to footnote something. ^[footnote text] The footnote will be in a smaller font and placed appropriately. Endnotes work in much the same way.

## Bibliographies

Of course you will need to cite things, and you will probably accumulate an armful of sources. There are a variety of tools available for creating a bibliography database (stored with the .bib extension).  In addition to BibTeX suggested below, you may want to consider using the free and easy-to-use tool called Zotero.  The Duke librarians have created Zotero documentation at <https://library.duke.edu/research/zotero>.  In addition, a tutorial is available from Middlebury College at <http://sites.middlebury.edu/zoteromiddlebury/>.

_R Markdown_ uses _pandoc_ (<http://pandoc.org/>) to build its bibliographies.  One nice caveat of this is that you won't have to do a second compile to load in references as standard LaTeX requires. To cite references in your thesis (after creating your bibliography database), place the reference name inside square brackets and precede it by the "at" symbol.  For example, here's a reference to a book about worrying:  [@Molina1994].  This `Molina1994` entry appears in a file called `thesis.bib` in the `bib` folder.  This bibliography database file was created by a program called BibTeX.  You can call this file something else if you like (look at the YAML header in the main .Rmd file) and, by default, is to placed in the `bib` folder.  

For more information about BibTeX and bibliographies, see the following documentation from Reed College at (<http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/index.html>)^[@reedweb2007]. There are three pages on this topic:  _bibtex_ (which talks about using BibTeX, at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtex.html>), _bibtexstyles_ (about how to find and use the bibliography style that best suits your needs, at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtexstyles.html>) and _bibman_ (which covers how to make and maintain a bibliography by hand, without BibTeX, at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibman.html>). The last page will not be useful unless you have only a few sources.

If you look at the YAML header at the top of the main .Rmd file you can see that we can specify the style of the bibliography by referencing the appropriate csl file.  You can download a variety of different style files at <https://www.zotero.org/styles>.  Make sure to download the file into the csl folder.

**Tips for Bibliographies**

- Like with thesis formatting, the sooner you start compiling your bibliography for something as large as thesis, the better. Typing in source after source is mind-numbing enough; do you really want to do it for hours on end in late April? Think of it as procrastination.
- The cite key (a citation's label) needs to be unique from the other entries.
- When you have more than one author or editor, you need to separate each author's name by the word "and" e.g. `Author = {Noble, Sam and Youngberg, Jessica},`.
- Bibliographies made using BibTeX (whether manually or using a manager) accept LaTeX markup, so you can italicize and add symbols as necessary.
- To force capitalization in an article title or where all lowercase is generally used, bracket the capital letter in curly braces.

## Anything else?

If you'd like to see examples of other things in this template, please contact Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel (email <mine@stat.duke.edu>) with your suggestions. We love to see people using _R Markdown_ for their theses, and are happy to help.

# Organization {#organization}

Your paper should be an evolving report on the project in all aspects developed so far, in the form of a draft scientific paper. It must be written in RMarkdown or LaTeX with figures included.

Make sure all figures have font sizes and line widths set so that the final pdf versions are properly legible. Presentation (including correctness of mathematical equations, graphics, tables, citations and bibligraphy, as well as prose) should be pristine.

All details of developments of models, code and examples/analyses must be clearly described -- sufficient to that a knowledgeable reader will be able to follow the logic and replicate the analysis.

By the end of the first (Fall) semester, you need to develop a readable interim report. In the second (Spring) semester your task is to evolve this paper into a complete write-up of your work, as if intending to consider submitting to a scientific journal.

However primitive the content may seem to be at the start, start writing.

A fairly standard outline is as follows:

- **Title**
- **Abstract**
- **Chapter 1. Introduction** (setting, problem description, citations, etc.)
- **Chapter 2. Literature review**
- **A Next Chapter:** Some papers have one or two chapters, some papers have several. Keep chapters relatively short: Each section should have one focus. For example,
    + **Chapter 3. New Statistical Models** (theory, ideas)
    + **Chapter 4. Some Computational Issues**
    + **Chapter 5. Simulated Data** (evaluation of models)
    + **Chapter 6. Application** (real motivating problem and data)
    + ...
- **Chapter X. Conclusion** (what was done, what was learned, what was good/bad, where research might or could go next) 
- **Appendix** (maybe some extra math, details of code)
- **Bibliography** (use bibtex, per the example bib files)

<!--chapter:end:04-organization.Rmd-->

# Conclusion {-}

If we don't want Conclusion to have a chapter number next to it, we can add the `{-}` attribute.

**More info**

And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter title or section head _shouldn't be_ indented, because indents are to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add an indent there.


<!--chapter:end:05-conclusion.Rmd-->

`r if(knitr:::is_latex_output()) '\\appendix'`

`r if(!knitr:::is_latex_output()) '# (APPENDIX) Appendix {-}'` 

<!--
If you feel it necessary to include an appendix, it goes here.
-->


# The First Appendix

This first appendix includes all of the R chunks of code that were hidden throughout the document (using the `include = FALSE` chunk tag) to help with readibility and/or setup.

**In the main Rmd file**

```{r ref.label='include_packages', results='hide', echo = TRUE}
```

**In Chapter \@ref(ref-labels):**

```{r ref.label='include_packages_2', results='hide', echo = TRUE}
```

# The Second Appendix, for Fun

<!--chapter:end:06-appendix.Rmd-->

<!--
The bib chunk below must go last in this document according to how R Markdown renders.  More info is at http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html

<!-- 
If you'd like to change the name of the bibliography to something else,
delete "References" and replace it.
-->

# References {-}
<!--
This manually sets the header for this unnumbered chapter.
-->
\markboth{References}{References}
<!--
To remove the indentation of the first entry.
-->
\noindent

<!--
To create a hanging indent and spacing between entries.  These three lines may need to be removed for styles that don't require the hanging indent.
-->

\setlength{\parindent}{-0.20in}
\setlength{\leftskip}{0.20in}
\setlength{\parskip}{8pt}


<!--
This is just for testing with more citations for the bibliography at the end.  Add other entries into the list here if you'd like them to appear in the bibliography even if they weren't explicitly cited in the document.
